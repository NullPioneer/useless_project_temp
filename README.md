### Project Description
Ever stared at your half-empty sanitizer or shampoo bottle and wondered, ‚ÄúHow many days until this magical elixir runs out?‚Äù Well, wonder no more! Introducing Snap & Track ‚Äî the absolutely indispensable, borderline ridiculous Bottle Analyzer prototype that uses fancy AI, OCR, and your wild clicking skills to estimate how many glorious days your bottle will last.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Let‚Äôs be honest: do we really need a fancy app to tell us how long our bottle of sanitizer or shampoo will last? Probably not. Most of us just eyeball the bottle, shrug, and hope it doesn‚Äôt run out when we need it most. Calculating exact usage days based on volume, number of people, and usage frequency might sound fancy, but in reality, who has the patience to measure every little thing?

Also, clicking precisely on bottle tops, bottoms, and reference objects in a photo sounds like a mini math quiz nobody signed up for. The OCR can sometimes get confused by smudges, fancy fonts, or weird lighting. And the machine learning model? It‚Äôs just guessing anyway.

In short, this app is more of a geeky prototype for fun than a must-have productivity tool. It‚Äôs solving a problem that maybe didn‚Äôt exist in the first place.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Since the world apparently needed a precise way to guess how many days your bottle will last ‚Äî and we‚Äôre all too lazy to do the math ourselves ‚Äî this app bravely steps in to save the day.

It uses some fancy AI magic (MobileNet), optical wizardry (OCR), and your very accurate clicking skills to measure bottle height and volume from a photo. Then it crunches the numbers based on how many people use it, how often, and how much they squeeze out each time.

Does it solve a real problem? Meh, debatable. But it does make you feel like a scientist activating an atomic bomb every time you hit ‚ÄúCalculate.‚Äù Plus, it keeps your bottle history safe ‚Äî because nostalgia is important, even for sanitizer.

So yes, it‚Äôs overkill for a simple task. But hey, sometimes pointless complexity is half the fun!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Language: JavaScript (ES6), HTML, CSS

Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow.js (MobileNet), Tesseract.js (OCR)

Tools: Browser-based, uses localStorage for persistence

Device with camera (smartphone, tablet, or webcam-enabled computer)

Modern web browser supporting ES6 and HTML5 features
### Implementation
For Software:No installation needed ‚Äî just open the HTML file in any modern browser.
# Installation
No installation needed ‚Äî just open the HTML file in any modern browser.

# Run
Open the index.html file directly or via a local server.
Click the camera icon to take a photo or upload an image.
Follow instructions to detect bottle height and reference object.
Enter usage details and calculate how many days your bottle will last.



### Project Documentation
For Software:
UI/UX: Simple dark theme, interactive image preview, click-to-measure interface

AI/ML: Uses MobileNet model to identify the product in the photo

OCR: Uses Tesseract.js to extract volume information from the image text

Calculation logic: Calculates days remaining based on volume, users, daily uses, and usage per use

Persistence: Saves scanned images and data to browser localStorage for history viewing and loading
